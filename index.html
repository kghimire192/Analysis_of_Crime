		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Public safety is one of the most fundamental rights of people. 
			To understand the level of public safety in an area, it is important to look at their crime rates. 
			Identifying regions with high crime rates allows for further investigation of underlying reasons for crimes, 
			and it also allows policymakers to deal with high (or increased) crime rates in certain region. </p>
		<br />
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>The analysis process of the project is to understand crime rates in the United States across time and across geographical regions. 
				The years used in the analysis is from year 2010 to 2017. District of Columbia has been treated as a US state in the analsis.
				Similarly, the geographical regions used in the analysis include New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central,
				South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain and Pacific. 
				Violent crimes and property crimes are two groups of crimes used in analysis. The crime data came from the annual 
				Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on FBIâ€™s official website.  </p>
		<br />
		<h3>Total Crime Growth Rate</h3>
		<p>The Geo chart below shows the total crime (violent and property crimes combined) rate growth from 2010 to 2017 for each of the US states. 
			The figure identifies North Dakota as the state with highest increase (39.67%) in crime rate from 2010 to 2017. Similarly, the chart also shows
			that there has been decrease in crime rates for a good number of US states with Maine having the highest drop (37.06%) in crime rates.

		<h3>Total Crime Rate by State</h3>
		<p>The bar graph below shows the total crime rate (per 100,000 population) for each state. The bar
			graphs identifies District of Columbia as the state with least public safety as it had the highest crime rates for each year from 2010 to 2017.
			 North Dakota, the state with highest crime growth rate, was identified as the state with least crime rate in year 2010.
			 Different years can be selected from the dropdown menu.</p>

		<h3>Total Crime Rate by Region</h3>
		<p>The line plot below acts as a time-series plot for total crime rate for each region from 2010 to 2017.
			The overall trend seems to be a decrease in total crime rate for each region. In 2010, Mid-Atlantic had the lowest crime rate. Similarly, 
			 New England had the least crime rate in 2017.

		<h3>Correlation between Violent and Property Crime Rates</h3>
		<p>The bubble chart below captures the relationship between violent crime rates and property crime rates. The average crime rates (from 2010 to 2017) has
			been used to plot the chart. The graph shows that the region with high violent crime rate seemed to also have high property crime rate. Similarly,
			the regions with low property crime rate also seemed to have lower violent crime rate.
