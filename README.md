## Analysis of Crime in the United States

This is a Data Visualization project that shows the crime rates in the United States across time (2010-2017) and across geographical regions. 

The website needs to be hosted on a Web Server (since it has visualizations using D3 library of JavaScript). One of the option is to use python as a web server:

python3 -m http.server
